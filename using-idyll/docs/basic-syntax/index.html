Creating a new page will also give you several examples that you can follow and adapt.
The purpose of this page is to outline key differences between Idyll and markdown/html as well as some notes about javascript use when embedding components.</p><h2 id="differences-from-html">Differences from HTML</h2><p>The main difference between Idyll and HTML is that Idyll uses <code>[]</code> instead of <code>&lt;&gt;</code>.
For things that do not have an open/close, such as <code>&lt;/br&gt;</code>, move the / to the end <br/> (<code>[br /]</code>).</p><p>When copying “embed” code generated for html, you will probably need to convert all <code>=</code> into <code>:</code> in addition to the above.</p><p>Example:
    <strong>Provided:</strong></p><pre><code>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://trinket.io/embed/python/48ba1cf9b8&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; 
marginheight=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></pre><strong>Altered to work in Idyll</strong><pre><code>[iframe src:&quot;https://trinket.io/embed/python/48ba1cf9b8?outputOnly=true&quot; width:&quot;100%&quot; height:&quot;600&quot; frameborder:&quot;0&quot; marginwidth:&quot;0&quot; 
marginheight:&quot;0&quot;]
[/iframe]</code></pre><h2 id="differences-from-markdown">Differences from Markdown</h2><p>Generally speaking, there are no major differences from markdown. 
However, there are some commands that (at time of writing) were either missing a functionality available in markdown or have a different (undetermined) syntax, such as sub-bullets.</p><p>All differences that I have noticed have seemed more like bugs than deliberate changes, and some have been patched.</p><h2 id="components-and-javascript">Components and JavaScript</h2><p>When embedding a component, you will often be using javascript-like syntax.
While you will still use <code>[]</code> surround everything, variables will go in `<code>backticks</code>`
, unlike the ”<code>quotes</code>″ used for most variables in html-like syntax.</p><p>Here is an example from the Idyll documentation:</p><pre><code>[Component propName:`2 * 2 * 2 * 2`/]</code></pre><p>The Idyll documentation mentions that backticks are needed for an evaluated expression;
the confusion I encountered is, what expressions count as evaluated?
This may need clarification for beginners.</p></div></div></div></div>
