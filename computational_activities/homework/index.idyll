         ## Overview
          [div className:"paddedParas"]
             Click the tabs to go to a specific homework page. Each of the homework
             tabs has Content, Homework, and Challenge Problem sections.
             Try to work these in order to get a full understanding of the subject matter.
             The homework will introduce Python as the semester progresses that will
             be tested in the Challenge Problem on the Trinket website.

             It is suggested to work through the homework problems by hand first
             using the given information, key equations, and references listed.
             Then, try to use Python to solve the same problem. While the associated
             math is important to understand, try to focus on the 'why' for each
             problem.

            ## Python skills

              The box to the right is an interactive Python 3 coding area by Trinket.
              These will be used to solve homework problems and focus on specific
              computational skills and Physics 2.

              #### Try it out!

            [ol]
              [li]
                Type ```x = 2``` under the ```## Variables``` heading and press the triangle button to run the code.
                There should be no output displayed. To edit the code, click the pencil button.

                ```x = 2``` means that we are storing the value (2) as a variable
                that can be called later. Under ```x = 2```, type ```y = 16.2```. This is
                another variable with a different value.

                For more information, click this link: [Python Variables](https://www.guru99.com/variables-in-python.html#:~:text=A%20Python%20variable%20is%20a,to%20the%20computer%20for%20processing)
              [/li]
              [li]
                Now type the following under the ```## Calculations``` heading:
                [ul]
                  [li]```add = x + y```[/li]
                  [li]```subt = y - x```[/li]
                  [li]```mult = y * 32.45 * x```[/li]
                  [li]```div = x/15```[/li]
                  [li]```power = x * 10**-19```[/li]
                [/ul]
              [/li]
              [li]
                Under the ```## Print``` heading, type the following print commands
                so that output displays when you click the run button:
                [ul]
                  [li]```print("addition:", add)```[/li]
                  [li]```print("subtraction:", subt)```[/li]
                  [li]```print(print("multiplication and division:", mult, div))```[/li]
                  [li]```print("power:", power, ",", power*10**19)```[/li]
                  [li]```print("a list:", list)```[/li]
                  [li]```print("a value from the list:", list[2])```[/li]
