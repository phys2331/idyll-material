  <p>Complete the steps below in the Trinket to solve this problem with Python. It is recommended that you type each line instead of copying/pasting
    so you start to remember what you've done previously.</p>

  <p>There may be multiple ways to get the correct answer. If you have a cool method, please fill out the feedback form for extra credit! See the footer or first page for the link.</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Under <code># Variables</code>, add a variable for the change in potential.</li>
   <li>In the same section, add a variable equal to the distance between location A and location B.</li>
   <li>Under <code># Calculate</code>, add a variable equal to the equation for the magnitude of the electric field.
     <ol type="a">
       <li>What is this equation? Remember that the electric field can also be expressed in volts per meter (V/m). Use the
       information given in the problem to figure out the equation and the answer. <b>Hint</b> - this strategy may help when taking standardized tests.</li>
     </ol>
   </li>
   <li>Under <code># Print</code>, print the electric field variable. Try to add units as a second string in print(). <b>Hint:</b> <code>print(String, variable, String)</code></li>
   <li>Click the run button (&#9658;) to output the answers!</li>
