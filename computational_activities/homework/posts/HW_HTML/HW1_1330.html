  <p>Complete the steps below in the Trinket to solve this problem with Python. It is recommended that you type each line instead of copying/pasting
    so you start to remember what you've done previously.</p>

  <p>There may be multiple ways to get the correct answer. If you have a cool method, please fill out the feedback form for extra credit! See the footer or first page for the link.</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Under <code># Import Libraries</code>, import NumPy.
     <ol type="i">
       <li>Need a refresher? Revisit the directions in <b>13.21</b>.</li>
     </ol>
   </li>
   <li>
     In the same section, import SciPy constants.
     <ol type="i">
       <li>Need a refresher? Revisit the directions in <b>13.30</b>.</li>
     </ol>
   </li>
   <li>Under <code># Variables</code>, add a variable that equals the given acceleration in the homework.</li>
   <li>Use SciPy constants to add another variable equal to the mass of a proton.</li>
   <li>Use SciPy constants to add another variable equal to elementary charge. What is this for?</li>
   <li>Under <code># Calculations</code>, set a variable equal to the electic field. Which equations can you use based on the given information? See the question at the beginning of this activity for help.</li>
   <li>Under <code># Print</code>, print the electric field variable. Try to add units as a second string in print(). <b>Hint:</b> <code>print(String, variable, String)</code></li>
   <li>Click the run button (&#9658;) to output the answers! Did you get the same numbers for both ways? Which one is faster?</li>
  </ol>
