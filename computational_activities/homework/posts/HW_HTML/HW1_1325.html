  <p>Complete the steps below in the Trinket to solve this problem with Python. It is recommended that you type each line instead of copying/pasting
    so you start to remember what you've done previously.</p>

  <p>There may be multiple ways to get the correct answer. If you have a cool method, please fill out the feedback form for extra credit! See the footer or first page for the link.</p>
  <ol>
   <li>Under <code># Import Libraries</code>, import NumPy.
     <ol type="i">
       <li>Need a refresher? Revisit the directions in <b>13.21</b>.</li>
     </ol>
   </li>
   <li>
     In the same section, add: <code>from scipy import constants</code>
     <ol type="i">
       <li>SciPy is another Python library that allows us to easily assign common constants to variables.</li>
       <li>Instead of importing all of SciPy, we are just importing the constants package. <code>from [library] import [package]</code> is a standard way to do this.</li>
       <li>
         There are a few ways to call a SciPy constant:
         <ol type="a">
           <li><code>constants.[constant]</code>. <b>Example:</b> <code>q1 = 2*constants.e</code> assigns 2 times the elementary
           charge to the q1 variable. This way pertains to the <b>Physical and Mathematical</b> constants listed at the top
           of the SciPy constants page (<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/constants.html">SciPy Constants</a>).</li>
           <li><code>constants.value(u'[constant]')</code>. <b>Example:</b> <code>p = constants.value(u'proton mass')</code> assigns the proton
           mass constant to the variable p. These constants are listed under the <b>Constants Database</b> on the linked page.</li>
         </ol>
       </li>
     </ol>
   </li>
   <li>Under <code># Constants</code>, add a variable that equals the charge of a proton and uses the SciPy constant for elementary charge.</li>
   <li>
     In the same section, add: <code>k = 1/(4*np.pi*constants.epsilon_0)</code>
     <ol type="i">
       <li>What is this constant? See the PowerPoint for Chapter 13 for a refresher.</li>
     </ol>
   </li>
   <li>
     This problem can be solved a few different ways. For this activity, we will solve it two ways in Python. Take note of which way makes
     sense to you and which way is the most efficient.
     <ol type="i">
       <li>
         Under <code># First Way</code>, create a variable for the proton location and set it equal to a NumPy array (See 13.21). <b>Hint:</b> set this location at the origin.
         <ol type="a">
           <li>Add another variable for the electron location and set it equal to a NumPy array. Use the distance given in the homework to figure out the location.</li>
           <li>Add a variable for \(\vec{r}\). Remember that \(\vec{r}\) is found by subtracting the location of the source charge from the observation location.
             Which is which in this question (Proton or electron)? Remember to use the variables you assigned.</li>
           <li>Add a variable for |\(\vec{r}\)|. What is this? The magnitude! Remember that we can use <code>np.linalg.norm()</code> to quickly find the
           magnitude of our vector. Use it and set it equal to your |\(\vec{r}\)| variable.</li>
           <li>Add a variable for \(\hat{r}\) and set it equal to your \(\vec{r}\) variable divided by your |\(\vec{r}\)| variable.</li>
           <li>
             Add: <code>E_field = (k*proton_charge)/(np.abs(r_vec_mag)**2)</code>
             <ul>
               <li>Here, <b>E_field</b> is the electric field, <b>proton_charge</b> is Q, and <b>r_vec_mag</b> is the magnitude of \(\vec{r}\)</li>
               <li><code>np.abs()</code> gives the absolute value of a variable. <code>np.absolute()</code> can be used for the same purpose.
               More information can be found here: <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.absolute.html">Absolute value</a></li>
             </ul>
           </li>
           <li>Add a variable for the magnitude of the electric field. Use <code>np.linalg.norm()</code></li>
           <li>
             Print the answer! Remember that there are multiple ways to do this.
             <ul>
               <li>Try: <code>print("First way answer:", "{:e}".format(E_field_mag))</code>, replacing <b>E_field_mag</b> with
               your variable for |\(\vec{E}\)|.</li>
               <li><code>”{:e}”.format()</code> is used here to put our answers into readable scientific notation. For more information, see
                the following link: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_format.asp">Python String format()</a></li>
             </ul>
           </li>
         </ol>
       </li>
       <li>
        Under <code># Second Way</code>, add a variable and set it equal to the distance between the electron and proton (what else is this equal to?).
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Add another variable equal to the magnitude of the electric field: <code>E_field2 = np.abs((k*proton_charge)/(np.abs(r)**2))</code></li>
          <li>Print the answer! Verify that it's the second variable equal to the magnitude of the electric field. Try to print it in scientific notation.</li>
        </ol>
       </li>
     </ol>
   </li>
   <li>Click the run button (&#9658;) to output the answers! Did you get the same numbers for both ways? Which one is faster?</li>
