        ## Problem Pages

          Click the tabs to go to a specific homework problem page.
          The problems are included in Homework 1 through WileyPlus. Work
          through the problems by hand first using the given information, key equations,
          and references listed. Then, try to use Python to solve the same problem.

          Each problem page has the following sections:

          #### Skills involved

          The skills involved in the particular homework problem will be tagged
          with other problems in the course that deal with the same content
          (*TO DO*). Click these to find more problems in these areas. It may
          help to look at the Resources page for videos and simulations that
          target specific skills these homework problems involve.

          #### Problem

          The problems will be listed as they are seen in WileyPlus. Note that
          the values will change for *each* problem.

          This section also includes a computation section.

          #### Important information

          To solve the homework problems, there are several areas that need to
          be understood. To help, the following sections are available:

          [ul]
            [li] **Objective**: summarizes what the question is asking. [/li]
            [li] **Key Equations**: lists the equations that may help in solving
            and understanding the problem. [/li]
            [li] **References**: lists the pages of the book where
            explanations of the concepts in the homework can be found. It may
            also include outside references that may be useful. [/li]
            [li] **Things to Think About**: covers tricky aspects of the
            question that may lead to incorrect answers. Thinking about these
            may help in solving the question faster. [/li]
          [/ul]
