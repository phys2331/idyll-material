           The problems are included in Homework 5 through WileyPlus. Work
           through the problems by hand first using the given information, key equations,
           and references listed. Then, try to use Python to solve the same problem.</p><p>Each problem page has the following sections:</p><h4 id="skills-involved">Skills involved</h4><p>The skills involved in the particular homework problem will be tagged
           with other problems in the course that deal with the same content
           (<em>TO DO</em>). Click these to find more problems in these areas. It may
           help to look at the Resources page for videos and simulations that
           target specific skills these homework problems involve.</p><h4 id="problem">Problem</h4><p>The problems will be listed as they are seen in WileyPlus. Note that
           the values will change for <em>each</em> problem.</p><p>This section also includes a computation section.</p><h4 id="important-information">Important information</h4><p>To solve the homework problems, there are several areas that need to
           be understood. To help, the following sections are available:</p><ul><li> <strong>Objective</strong>: summarizes what the question is asking. </li><li> <strong>Key Equations</strong>: lists the equations that may help in solving
             and understanding the problem. </li><li> <strong>References</strong>: lists the pages of the book where
             explanations of the concepts in the homework can be found. It may
             also include outside references that may be useful. </li><li> <strong>Things to Think About</strong>: covers tricky aspects of the
             question that may lead to incorrect answers. Thinking about these
             may help in solving the question faster. </li></ul><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><p>Need help doing physics problems in Python? Visit the Computational Activities pages.</p><p>Need help doing the physics problems? Check out the resources section
           on each problem page for specific text entries in Matter and Interactions
           and any outside resource that may help in solving them. Visit the resources
           page for videos and simulations about the specific physics problem.</p><hr/><div class="centerPara"><img src="./static/images/ucdenverlogo2.png" title="UC Denver"/><a href="https://clas.ucdenver.edu/physics/">Physics Department</a><br/><a href="https://forms.gle/58GeVKmnrP91HbtM9" target="_blank">Feedback Form</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
