          The problems are included in Homework 1 through WileyPlus. Work
          through the problems by hand first using the given information, key equations,
          and references listed. Then, try to use Python to solve the same problem.</p><p>Each problem page has the following sections:</p><h4 id="skills-involved">Skills involved</h4><p>The skills involved in the particular homework problem will be tagged

          be understood. To help, the following sections are available:</p><ul><li> <strong>Objective</strong>: summarizes what the question is asking. </li><li> <strong>Key Equations</strong>: lists the equations that may help in solving
            and understanding the problem. </li><li> <strong>References</strong>: lists the pages of the book where
            explanations of the concepts in the homework can be found. It may
            also include outside references that may be useful. </li><li> <strong>Things to Think About</strong>: covers tricky aspects of the
            question that may lead to incorrect answers. Thinking about these
            may help in solving the question faster. </li></ul><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><p>Need help doing physics problems in Python? Visit the blahblahblah page.</p><p>Need help doing the physics problems? Check out the resources section
          on each problem page for specific text entries in Matter and Interactions
          and any outside resource that may help in solving them. Visit the resources
