# Electroreception: An Evolutionary Advantage

## Background

Stefano Lorenzini, born in Florence in 1652, was a physician and ichthyologist. In 1678, he described the presence of pores leading to transparent tubes located around the mouths of sharks but for which he was unable to determine the purpose. This Italian scientist would never have imagined that these tubes, now called the ampullae of Lorenzini, allow sharks to perceive a world of electrical images that are imperceptible to human senses.

It was not until three hundred years later, in 1960, that this organ was finally identified as a specialized sense that perceives electric fields. It was then understood that these tubes offer a clear evolutionary advantage for the sea predators that have them. All living creatures produce an electric field when they contract their muscles. A shark can detect the weak electric stimuli from a prey and deduce its presence. How does this sixth sense function? What exactly is it capable of detecting?

The golden trout is a potential prey for sharks in the Pacific Ocean around the coasts of California in the USA. Although most trout live only in fresh water, some species, such as the golden trout (subspecies of rainbow trout) spend their adult life in the ocean and swim back up certain rivers in California to spawn, like salmon do. The golden trout can reach up to 71 cm long and weigh 5 kg in adulthood, so they make a very interesting meal for many sharks.

In this problem, you will have to describe the electric field produced by the beating of a trout’s heart and understand its role in relation to the shark’s electroreception sense. To help you understand the phenomenon, a trout, an aquarium, an electrocardiograph and lots of questions will be presented.

    ### Point Charge

    1) The vectors in the figure below represent the electric field of a point charge. 
    Between which of the points represented here by the letters A, B, C, D, E and F is the modulus of the potential difference [Equation display:false]\mathrm{\Delta V}[/Equation] the highest? The lowest?

    ![Figure 3. The point charge is positive, with arrows pointing away from it and getting smaller the further away they are. Assigning a rough coordinate system with the point charge at (0,0), A is at (-1,-2.5), B is at (1,-1), C is at (6.5,-5), D is at (-1.5, 3.5), E is at (-9,6.5), and F is at (-6,-6).](static/images/field_point_charge.png)
    // While it is still a rough coordinate system, I made these coordinates by hand-drawing a grid in GIMP to get something that should be close enough to accurate.

    ##The Trout and the Shark

    [/Float]

    Some sharks are more sensitive to electric fields than any other animal, because they have a sensitivity threshold of up to 0.5 μV/m. 

    Using an electrocardiograph, it is possible to measure the size of the electric field generated by a trout. 
    For this experiment, a trout is placed in an aquarium. 
    Then two sensors connected to an electrocardiograph are submerged in the aquarium near the trout as shown in Figure 5. 
    The electrocardiograph records the signal in millivolts (mV) and it measures the electrical potential difference between the two sensors, as shown in Figure 6.

    To simplify the model, we use an electric dipole to represent the muscular contraction of the trout’s heart. When the potential difference generated by the trout is the highest, the distance between the point charges of the dipole representing the system is 1 cm, the size of the trout’s heart, as shown in Figure 7.

    ![Figure 6. The pulse is fairly regular, with most peaks being between 1.1 and 1.3 mV. There is one pulse which spikes up to 1.5 mV.](static/images/cardiograph.png)

    ## Did You Know?
    An electric field does not behave exactly the same way in vacuum as in water. The dielectric permittivity of a substance, [Equation display:false]\kappa[/Equation], is the factor by which the electric field is decreased or increased relative to vacuum. At low frequencies, at room temperature and at a certain level of salinity, the dielectric permittivity of water has a value of 80.

    Electric field of a dielectric: 

    [Equation display:true] E_D = \frac{E_0}{\kappa} [/Equation] 

    where [Equation display:false]E_D[/Equation] is the modulus of the electric field in the dielectric and [Equation display:false]E_0[/Equation] is the modulus of the electric field in vacuum.

    Therefore we can assume that Coulomb’s constant in vacuum, [Equation display:false]k_0[/Equation], will differ based on the value of the dielectric permittivity.
    
    [Equation display:true] k_D = \frac{k_0}{\kappa} [/Equation]

// This doesn't have a strong ending. I think choosing one "best" question and putting it separately at the end could help quite a bit, but I don't know which one we could deem to be the most important.

# Summary

*Summary goes here.* // Below is only what I've written to help me work out the problems.

To calculate the maximum electric charge in the dipole, we started by determining the maximum voltage, which based on figure 6 was 1.5 \[mV\].
(Because the distance across the dipole is constant, the only way that the voltage can change is if the charge is changing.)
We also know from figure 7 that the distance across the dipole was 1 \[cm\].
If we approximate the field within the dipole as constant, then the equation: // No clue whether this is actually an acceptible approximation - I think it is because the distance is small but that's all I've got.
// Mostly I think the approximation is acceptable because I don't think this problem intended to be overly complicated.

[Equation display:true]\Delta V = -\int \vec{E} \cdot \vec{dl}[/Equation]

can be simplified because the angle between the field and the path is constant, giving:

[Equation display:true]
\begin{array}{rcl}
  |\Delta V| & = & \int |\vec{E}||\vec{dl}||cos\theta| \\
  & = & E|cos\theta| |\int dl| \\
  & = & E|cos\theta| |\Delta l| \\
\end{array}
[/Equation]

Choosing a path that points in the same direction as the electric field, [Equation display:false]\theta[/Equation] becomes 0, making [Equation display:false]cos\theta[/Equation] 1, giving us:

[Equation display:true]
\begin{array}{rcl}
  1.5 \mathrm{mV} & = & E \mathrm{cm} \\
  0.15 \mathrm{V/m} & = & E
\end{array}  
[/Equation]
